# PDF to Text Converter

This is a simple Python script that converts PDF files to plain text files using the `pdf2image` and `pytesseract` libraries.

## Installation

To use this script, you need to install the following libraries:

- `pdf2image`
- `pytesseract`
- `Pillow`

You can install these libraries using pip:


The script will open a GUI window where you can select the input PDF file and choose the output text file. Once you have selected the files, click the "Convert" button to convert the PDF to text.

The script will use OCR (optical character recognition) to extract the text from the PDF. This process may take some time, depending on the size of the PDF.

You can track the progress of the conversion using the progress bar in the GUI window.
